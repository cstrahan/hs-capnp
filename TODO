QUESTIONS
---------
- how should default values work for non-scalar types?
  - Presently, I pass around around (Ptr WirePtr), but the only way that's sound
    is if I perform a copy into a new segment / bytestring.
    Perhaps I should pass around a segment (or arena?)
  - How does this work in libcapnp? My guess is that code generator puts the
    default values in statically allocated memory.
    - I need to inspect the default values in a CodeGeneratorRequest and see
      what I can make work.

TODO
----
- complete data structures and core layout API.
- write code generator
- replace the current schema code, completing the bootstrap
- clean-up choice of integral types (remove uncessary use of `fromIntegral`)
- profile / optimize

DONE
----
- create sample messages
  - inspect
  - make sure the offsets match what I would expect
  - write tests
